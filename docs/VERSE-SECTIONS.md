# Verse melody writer: sections and variety (experiment)

The verse melody card (`src/verse/`) writes a verse and now a chorus, one rule at a time. Goal: great songs that don't sound alike.

## How it fits together
- `profile.ts`: **dials**, every number the rules roll against (phrase lengths, runs, holds, endings, lift...). `VERSE` is the verse as it always was.
- `personality.ts`: a song's **personality**, drawn once from the song seed, tilted (never forced) by genre and mood. Each trait has its own random stream, so adding a trait later leaves the others alone. `dialsFor(kind, personality)` gives a section its dials.
- `section.ts`: an idea (a verse or chorus of the track) to the writer's input; shared by the card and the check.
- `build.ts`: the rule pipeline per leaf of the form (A A' ...).

## Variety rules (keep these true)
- Nothing is fixed: every trait is a weighted menu, and "none" (plain endings, level choruses) is a real option.
- A chorus ends phrases in one of: held, open (3rd/5th), hang (off the chord), punch (short), sync (early, off the beat), plain. A held ending is never required.
- Hooks: chant, anthem, leap, push. Chorus height: +5, +3, level, -2.
- `npm run verse-variety` writes ~224 real songs and prints how each trait spreads. Anything marked `!!` has one value winning too often: retune the weights in `personality.ts`. Also counts near-duplicate choruses.

## Choruses
- **One melody per song's chorus.** The song's last chorus (the fullest) is the master: every other chorus of the same length is written with the master's seed, energy and band hits, over its own chords. The rhythm and shape are the same; pitches follow each chorus's chords. Words are shared where the rhythm matches. (Before: each chorus was written from its own energy and chords, so 9 songs in 10 had choruses that differed.) No stripping of the vocal in earlier choruses: the build-up is the band's.
- **Silence.** Each song draws how much of its chorus has no vocals: 30-50%, a squared draw so 30% is common and 50% rare (`chorusSilence`). Rule 18 (`fitSilence`) fits every chorus to it, within 3 points: too full, the weakest notes drop out (short, off the band's hits, off the beat; never a phrase's first or last note, a walk or a long note), then long notes let go of their last 8th; too empty, notes are held into the gaps, then phrase endings are held on into the break. The verse is untouched.
- **Longer notes, fewer notes, more bends.** Rule 17 (`withStretch`): a plain 8th is held through the next on the same chord note (a beat, now and then a beat and a half), by hook. Fewer 16th runs; more long notes; bends about 3x the verse's chances (about 6 a chorus).
- The chorus's second half answers the first (how much: drawn per song).

## Singing
- A held phrase ending fades out in volume (10, 16 or 24 dB over its last half), never in pitch; half as far if that note bends.
- The card's **Human feel** switch (on by default) runs the experiment line through the main vocal's human feel (`guide/feel.ts`): glides, scoops, swells, a short fade at every word end, a softer last word, a breath before lines after a rest. The ending fade above stays when it is the longer one.

## Next
Pre-chorus (climb / stall / stop / call / none), verse 2 answering verse 1, a lifted last chorus, bridge, outro.
